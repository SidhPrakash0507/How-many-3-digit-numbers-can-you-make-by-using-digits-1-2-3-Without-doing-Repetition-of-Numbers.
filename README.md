# How-many-3-digit-numbers-can-you-make-by-using-digits-1-2-3-Without-doing-Repetition-of-Numbers.

In this Scenario we use  permutations function from the itertools module to find all the unique 3-digit numbers that can be made using the digits 1, 2, and 3. The permutations function takes two arguments: the first is the iterable to generate permutations from (in this case, the list nums), and the second is the length of the permutations to generate (in this case, 3). The result of the permutations function is a set of tuples, where each tuple represents a unique 3-digit number. The length of this set is then printed to give the number of unique 3-digit numbers that can be made.
